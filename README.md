This Is a Point Of Sales System for Cosmetics

Here's how it works:

-After logging in, (username: admin, password: admin123) you'll see the main app, and there is a sidebar on your left with 4 buttons in form of images
- When you hover each image(button) on the sidebar, you'll see a label displayed i.e Sales, Products, Users and Products Respectively
- Clickng each button(image) on the sidebar will open a new page - Sales Page, Product Page, Users Page and Suppliers Page

PRODUCTS PAGE
-You can try addig a new product on the product page, which has 3 tabs, one to show all available products, the 
 2nd tab allows you to add a new product or category by clicking the "Add category" btn which enables
the category entry widget on thebotto right, the 3rd tab allows you to Search, Update or Delete any product 

USERS PAGE
-You can add a new user, view all existing users and also edit user details after confirming your credentials in the 
"Login Group Box". If the login credentials are correct, the "Edit User Details Group Box" will be enabled, allowing you to edit
the users info.


SUPPLIERS PAGE
- Here you can add a new supplier and the supplier details will appear on the tables below.
-You caan also search and edit the suppliers details on the "Edit supplier's info page"


SALES PAGE
I saved the last for best and I beleive this is the most important part of the system, and where most of the magic happens.
-The sales page is the 1st to be loaded when the user logs in.

-Click the "Add New Sales" btn and a sales window will pop up.
-Here you can select the product you want to sell and on selecting, you'll see the unit price uupdated below.
- You can confirm the "unit cost" from the "products table" in tha "products page", just to confirm 
that the 2 are in sync.
- While still in the "Sales Window" You can use the spinBox to increment the quantity and the total cost will be reflected and
click "Okay" when done.
- Once the window closes after clicking the "Okay" btn,  hit the "Refresh" btn and the product you just sold will 
	be dispayed on the  sales table.

- Try selling the same product again on the same day and you'll see that the changes will be reflected on the sales table, "List of all sales"
efter you hit the "Refresh button" 
The changes will also be reflected on the "products table" on the Product page i.e the quantity will have been deducted by the quantity you just sold




The coolest part of it all is that you can export all the sales to the desktop in form of an "Excel file" 
once you hit the "Export as excel file" on the right

			Enjoy! Thank You!
